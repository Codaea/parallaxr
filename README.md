# parallaxr
A Parallax maker from images.

## What this project will do

this app is for making parallaxing videos, that can be exported in a variety of formats, from images imported with transparent backgrounds. 
in theory, it will have 

- import images as layers (bulk)
- manually change speed of each layers
- select layers that don't move (nachor layers)
- select export fps

> need to spit the above into mutliple diffrent features and issue sets.
